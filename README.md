This is my blog: [hamsterniknotes.com](http://hamsterniknotes.com)

Before you can start to deal with the codebase you need to install [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) as CLI application. 
For Homebrew users just type `brew install publish` and wait until the process will be done.

To run the blog locally you should call the next comand:

```bash
$ publish run
```

Blog would be available in a moment at `localhost:8000`. Make your changes and refresh the page in the browser.
